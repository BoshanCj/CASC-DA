# CASC-DA
Official implementation of **CASC-DA** for cross-scene hyperspectral image (HSI) classification under domain shift. CASC calibrates semantic structure via BAL (reweighting), SPE (margin), and IND (dependency regularization), and DualAlign aligns features (CORAL) and predictions (symmetric KL). The code will come soon.
